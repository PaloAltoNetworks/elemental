// Package elemental provides a set of interfaces and structures used to manage a model generated from a
// Regolithe Specifications Set.
//
// If you are not familiar with with Regolithe, please read https://github.com/aporeto-inc/regolithe.
//
// Elemental is the basis of Bahamut (https://github.com/aporeto-inc/bahamut) and Manipulate
// (https://github.com/aporeto-inc/manipulate).
//
// The main interface it provides is the Identifiable. This interface must be implemented by all object of a model.
// It allows to identify an object from its Identity (which is a name and category) and by its identifier. It also
// embeds the Versionable interface that allows to retrieve the current version of the model. The Identifiables
// interface must be implemented by lists managing a collection of Identifiable entities.
//
// The ModelManager is an interface to perform lookup on Identities, Relationships between them and also allow to
// instantiate objects based on their Identity.
//
// Elemental also contains some Request/Response structures representing various Operation on Identifiable or
// Identifiables as well as a bunch of validators to enforce specification constraints on attributes like max length,
// pattern etc.
// There is also an Event structure that can be used to notify clients of the the result of an Operation sent through
// a Request.
//
// Elemental is mainly an abstract package and cannot really be used by itself. You must use the provided command
// (elegen) to generate an Elemental Model from a Regolithe Specification Set.
